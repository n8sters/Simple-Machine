# Simple-Machine
Programs for a simple accumulator based machine.

These programs are for a accumulator based machine, written in RTL/RTN 
They work at the most basic level, getting and setting memory addresses, and performing simple operations. 
Programs like these help one appreciate how miraculous it is when we turn our computers on, and they don't 
immediately burst into flames. 
Most of these programs are for my personal use, as writing programs for the "Simple Machine" are part 
of a course I am taking on Computer Architecture and Assembler.
